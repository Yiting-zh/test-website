  <h2>Hi~ I am Yiting</h2>
  
  <p>My name is Yiting. I am a self-taught UX designer with two years of experience in marketing. I am eager to study this course because it perfectly aligns with my goals of mastering web programming and development. As a self-taught UX designer, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to create intuitive and engaging user experiences, but Iâ€™ve realized that bridging the gap between design and development is crucial for building truly impactful products.
