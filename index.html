          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>My name is Yiting. </p>
           <p> I am a self-taught UX designer with two years of experience in marketing. I am eager to study this course because it perfectly aligns with my goals of mastering web programming and development. </p>
           <p>
            As a self-taught UX designer, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to create intuitive and engaging user experiences, but Iâ€™ve realized that bridging the gap between design and development is crucial for building truly impactful products.

        <h2> My work</h2>
        <p>
          The story begins four years ago. In 2020, I moved to Sweden to finish my masterâ€™s degree, with no clear idea of what I wanted to do or what the future held. My first internship was in marketing, which broadened my perspective on product development and taught me how user experiences need to align with business goals and target audiences.
        </P>
        <p>
          While marketing was a valuable experience, I soon realized it wasnâ€™t the path I wanted to follow. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about creating and solving problems, which naturally led me to UX design. In UX, I found a perfect blend of creativity and analytical thinking. It allowed me to design user-centered experiences that were both functional and visually appealing. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So, it might seem like I had found my ideal career in UX design. But waitâ€”why am I here applying for the IT programming program???
